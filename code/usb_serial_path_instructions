dir /dev/serial/by-path
use the path in that directory that is linked to by the ttyUSBx corresponding 
to the usb serial device you want to use, e.g.:
/dev/serial/by-path/platform-fd500000.pcie-pci-0000:01:00.0-usb-0:1.2:1.0-port0
this link will be stable as long as the USB device isn't moved to another physical port
